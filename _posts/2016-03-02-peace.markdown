We must work to eliminate mindless aggression. Acts of aggression must be calculated; they must not be enacted without thought. We should take time with trying to learn the circumstances surrounding the events at hand and come to peace with what has led us to this point.

To strike out in anger is to act as a beast, brute, or fiend. To strike out in anger is to declare you are disgraceful and incapable of controlling yourself or the actions of your everyday life, that the world is much too difficult for you to meditate on a moment. One must understand themselves and the objective at hand before fully understanding how to act.

The default action of any action should be to act towards peace. Not simply remaining passive, but rather working towards peace. Although it can seem like a contradiction, to bring peace through confrontation is a peace more likely to last. It quickly address the problem at hand and ensures all parties are aware of the motivations behind taking said actions.
