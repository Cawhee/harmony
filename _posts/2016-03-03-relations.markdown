The interpersonal interactions one has with one another highlight their lives. Those who do not engage interpersonally are not remembered.

To engage in conversation, to touch another, is to take a step in interpersonal engagement. These engagements are to leave breadcrumbs behind of who we are, who we were. But this is not their sole purpose.

Outside this building of legacy comes exploration; to venture forward and reject the label of passatismo; to discover what is new from those around beyond your own mind and kin. Interpersonal engagements expand our horizons beyond what we already know. They are necessary, they are intriguing, and they build to provide a better understanding of the world around us. They are unavoidable for as humans we are social creatures, born to be raised by our parents, brought to manhood by our tribe, and thrust forth to venture outside our tribes to explore the world and adopt its ideas. These engagements slowly evolve into regular exchanges which in turn make up the bases of our relationships.

But when does one know? When does one know when these regular exchanges constitute a relationship? This is what has been pondered by the men of old age. When do our interactions constitute a relationship? The controversial experimental psychologist Stanley Milgram ran a series of experiments throughout the 1970s where he identified the phenomenon of the “familiar stranger.” The familiar stranger is the man you encounter on your walk to work, the woman who you ride the elevator with every morning; the people whose existence does not seem necessary to your daily life. And yet, Milgram discovered these people did matter. The same people you see on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. basis are the very people who help to give our days stability. They have purpose.

All relationships have a purpose. Finding this purpose can often be difficult to do. In the case of the familiar purpose, our relationship is designed to give our lives stability and order. We notice our familiar strangers go missing because they fail to fulfill their purpose of filling the empty space of a subway car or carry the scent of their perfume into a crowded stairwell. But these are merely the relationships between strangers, are they not? If one thinks they have relationships which are purposeless, perhaps one should ask themselves why they engage in them to begin with? For all relationships fulfill a purpose whether they be healthy or not—and those which are negative are often easiest to identify.

But again, when does this shift from stranger to familiar stranger come? When does the shift from any of these levels come? That is what we must ask ourselves,

stranger,

familiar stranger,

acquaintance,

friend,

lover,

kin.
